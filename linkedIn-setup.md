# LinkedIn API Tutorial – Share on LinkedIn

This guide walks you through setting up a LinkedIn Developer app and using the API to share posts programmatically.  
By the end, you’ll be able to authenticate with OAuth and publish content from Postman or your own application.

### Steps

1. **Go to Developer Portal**  
   Visit [LinkedIn Developer](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and sign in with your LinkedIn account.  

2. **Create an App**  
   Set up a new app. Note: this requires you to be an admin of a LinkedIn Company Page.  

3. **Verify the App**  
   Complete LinkedIn’s verification (email or company page confirmation).  

4. **Add Products**  
   Enable products like **Sign in with LinkedIn** and **Share on LinkedIn** to get the required permissions.  

5. **Create OAuth Token**  
   Generate an OAuth 2.0 access token by defining scopes (e.g., `w_member_social` for posting).  

6. **Test with Postman**  
   Use the token to call the LinkedIn API from Postman and post content to your LinkedIn profile.
